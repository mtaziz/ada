    "The very first thing we have to think about is what data we want to use.

Thus, we have to determine what kind of information - and how much - we want to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we decide to take the **yearly** average for the unemployment rates and not the monthly ones, thus getting data from 2016 and not from 2017. For the monthly rates, we could have information for the beginning of this year, but we decide against it, as will not give an accurate picture due to seasonal changes in unemployment (think of tourism industy etc.). Choosing the yearly average allows us to not have to deal with any fluctuation due to seasonal workers that would not be seen as unemployed for a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, seeing as the idea is to compare the unemployment rate of Europe to that of Switzerland, it would be more appropriate to take the data by country rather than that per NUTS 2 region, even more so seeing as Switzerland is cut in several in that dataset. So, to be able to compare it to Switzerland as a whole, we should have Switzerland as only one entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we also need data that includes Switzerland, as it is not always the case for all files about unemployment in Europe. Thus, we had to dig a bit deeper and find data on unemployment according to age, sex and nationality (which contains rates for Switzerland, compared to data in the main indicators), which restricts it to people of age 15 to 74. This is actually what we want as those are the \"adults\" that could be potentially working already, and people that are younger or older should not count in our rates, as they aren't part of the working force.\n",
