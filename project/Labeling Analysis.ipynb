    "- Tweets were labeled \"losely\" using multiple signs of mental distress, mostly sadness. Thus, tweets with the following specificities were labeled as showing mental distress: nostalgia (either for the past or simply for the end of a nice day), mention of sad activities (people who watched sad movies, listened to sad songs as this was most probably triggered by a previous feeling of sadness) or mention of being mad (either over other people like haters or, more often, mad with their families)\n",
    "- Some tweets mentioned the mental distress of other people (either how they helped them or raising awareness over these issues)\n",
    "- Some tweets showed desperation (a form of mental distress) over the \"way the world is\", these were not included.\n",
    "- Some tweets only included _\"motivational\"_ quotes. We can suppose that these reflect bad times. Nonetheless, these were not included as our previous assumption is a little far-fetched. Moreover, this could have messed with our model (they did not include specific words of our dictionary nor specific mentions to mental distress).\n",
    "- A lot of mental distress tweets are related to unilateral feelings. They are often messages specifically targeted at someone who most certainly doesn't know their existence (for example work collegues or college classmates).\n",
    "- Most tweets talking about depression or terrible low self-esteem show _« covert-humour »_, a coping technique used to hide ones self-deprecation. These tweets are very difficult to detect as they use sarcasm (which can not be perceived using current NLP techniques) and seldom use words from or dictionary.\n",
