Statistics:

- 30-35 per cent of the population suffers from mental disorders
- he Swiss Health Observatory released a report stating that “it is possible that 17 per cent of the population could be suffering from psychological disorders”.
- On average some 38.2 per cent of people in Europe suffer from psychological disorders, the report states.


Natural Language Processing:
- we should use stemming before trying to find dictionary matches to find matches accordingly
- lemmatisation or stemming not both.
- I don't see the purpose of LDA\VSA
- We should use Ngrams for? <- analyze coccurring words?
- I think ski-kit learn does most of this for us, at least LSI
- machine learning would be cool but supervised -> we have to lable tweets: has been done with ca 4000
- most similar studies use superwised learning
 - unsupervised: KNN maybe?

Handling data over time:
- since we are dealing with 6 months, look at month differences, just use timestamp group by month and analyze data by month using plots
