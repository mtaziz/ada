    "- Some tweets showed desperation (a form of mental distress) over the \"way the world is\", these were not included.\n",
    "- An unexpected insight (which we decided not to pursue further as it was too tenuous) was the link between summer and mental distress. Indeed, most of tweets mentioning summer showed some sadness due to the absence of friends (from university for example).\n",
    "- Some tweets only included _\"motivational\"_ quotes. We can suppose that these reflect bad times. Nonetheless, these were not included as our previous assumption is a little far-fetched. Moreover, this could have messed with our model (they did not include specific words of our dictionary nor specific mentions to mental distress).\n",
    "- A lot of mental distress tweets are related to unilateral feelings. They are often messages specifically targeted at someone who most certainly doesn't know their existence (for example work collegues or college classmates).\n",
    "- Most tweets talking about depression or terrible low self-esteem show _« covert-humour »_, a coping technique used to hide ones self-deprecation.
